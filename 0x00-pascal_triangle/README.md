# Pascal's triangle

Pascal's triangle is a triangle of numbers whose value is the sum of two numbers above them.

All rows of numbers begin and end with 1's and the sum of each row is equavalent to the 2^n^, where **n** is the row number.

It is also applied in the Binomial Theorem where each row represents the coefficients of a binomial expression.

(a + b)^2^ = a^2^ + 2ab + b^2^

Coefficients of this expression are - **1 , 2 , 1** - which are the second row of the pascal's triangle. Theis sum is 4 which is also equivalent to **2^2^**.
